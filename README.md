# DSA Practice – Python

This repository contains my daily Data Structures and Algorithms practice solutions in Python.

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build strong logic and pattern recognition
- Prepare for coding interviews

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash Maps
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Valid Anagram (Sorting approach)
- Subsets (Iterative expansion method)

## Structure
Each file contains:
- Problem name
- Approach explanation
- Time & Space complexity

## Current Progress
- Two Sum
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Roman to Integer
- Longest Common Prefix
- String manipulation
- Sorting complexity
- Power set generation
- Iterative subset building


I update this repository regularly as I solve new problems.
